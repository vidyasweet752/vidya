            Lotus (Nelumbo Nucifera Gaertn) is the National Flower of India. It is a sacred flower and occupies a unique position in the art and mythology of ancient India and has been an auspicious symbol of Indian culture since time immemorial.

            India is rich in flora. Currently available data place India in the tenth position in the world and fourth in Asia in plant diversity. From about 70 per cent geographical area surveyed so far, 47,000 species of plants have been described by the Botanical Survey of India (BSI).
            Lotus, a latinization of Greek lōtos (λωτός),[4] is a genus of flowering plants that includes most bird's-foot trefoils (also known as bacon-and-eggs[5]) and deervetches[6] and contains many dozens of species distributed worldwide. Depending on the taxonomic authority, roughly between 70 and 150 are accepted. Lotus is a genus of legumes and its members are adapted to a wide range of habitats, from coastal environments to high altitudes.

            The genus Lotus is currently undergoing extensive taxonomic revision. Species native to the Americas have been moved into other genera, such as Acmispon and Hosackia, as in the second edition of The Jepson Manual.
            
            The aquatic plant commonly known as the Indian or sacred lotus is Nelumbo nucifera, a species not closely related to Lotus.

        The Royal Bengal Tiger is the national animal of India because of its rich cultural history, abundance, characteristics and conservation efforts.

        In April 1972, the Royal Bengal Tiger was declared to be the national animal of India. The national animal of a country is often a symbolic representation of the country’s rich heritage and culture. With that in mind, there are several criteria for choosing a national animal.

        A country should identify itself with the characteristics displayed by the animal. The animal should naturally be indigenous to that country, be in abundance, and be a symbol of the history of the country, as well as add to the visual beauty and appeal of the nation. A country can also select a national animal on a conservation basis if it needs to be protected in order to continue its survival.

            There is no national sport of India. Neither Hockey nor Kabaddi is not a national game of India (Source: Right To Information).
            Hockey was one of the ancient games, and the Indian Hockey Federation was authorized in 1925. The first international hockey trip for Indians was against New Zealand, where 21 matches were conducted, out of which India won 18 Matches, withdrew 2 matches, and lost 1 match. This victory helped the Indian hockey team to outstand among other countries.

            This victory against New Zealand encouraged the citizens of India to play the game hockey. The hockey game was popularly played from the period of 1928 to 1956. This period was considered the golden era since India won 6 succeeding gold medals in the Olympic games.

            A particular fruit is designated as the national fruit of a country when it fulfills some key fundamental requirements. It must represent a powerful facet of the cultural attributes that a country wants to convey to the world. The fruit must have an enriching part in the country’s history. It should also have a considerable presence in the religious and spiritual heritage of the country. Mango, affectionately called King of Fruits is the National fruit of India. Its sweet fragrance and delectable flavors have won the hearts of many around the world. Mangoes remain one of the most cultivated tropical fruits in the world. As the national fruit of India it represents prosperity, abundance and richness in favor of the country’s image. 

            Mango is one of the most widely grown fruits of the tropical countries. In India, mango is cultivated almost in all parts, with the exception of hilly areas. Mango is a rich source of Vitamins A, C and D. In India, we have hundreds of varieties of mangoes. They are of different sizes, shapes and colors. Mangoes have been cultivated in India since time immemorial. Even in our mythology and history there are stories of mangoes- the famous Indian poet Kalidasa sang its praise. Alexander the great, along with Hieun Tsang savored the taste of mangoes. The great Mughal king, Akbar is said to have planted over 100,000 mango trees in Darbhanga (modern Bihar). The mango is eaten ripe and is also used for pickles.

            The Indian peacock, Pavo cristatus, the national bird of India, is a colourful, swan-sized bird, with a fan-shaped crest of feathers, a white patch under the eye and a long, slender neck. The male of the species is more colourful than the female, with a glistening blue breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green tail of around 200 elongated feathers. The female is brownish, slightly smaller than the male and lacks the tail. The elaborate courtship dance of the male, fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a gorgeous sight.
